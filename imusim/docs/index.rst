IMUSim Documentation
--------------------

IMUSim is a simulator designed to model Inertial Measurement Units, i.e.
devices which include accelerometers and gyroscopes, and also magnetometers. It
was developed to help with research into algorithms for IMU-based motion
capture, but may be useful to help with the development of any system that uses
these types of sensors.

For more information see the `IMUSim homepage <http://www.imusim.org/>`_. This
page lists the documentation available for the current release.
